- For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
- For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
- If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
- "y" is treated like a vowel in appropriate circumstances.

create the var for "way" and "ay"
